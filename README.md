# Fluid Mixing in Grid-based Microfluidic Grids

## Description
This project provides a fast numerical approximation algorithm to predict the velocity and concentration of fluid at the outlets given the reactants, velocity, and concentration at the inlets. The application allows users to customize grid sizes, grid topology, dimensions of channels in the grids, and fluid properties such as diffusion coefficient, velocity, and concentration.

## Demo
The application is hosted at [Fluid Mixing Application](https://valentinoanny.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Features
Customize grid sizes and topologies  
Define dimensions of channels in the grids  
Set fluid properties such as diffusion coefficient, velocity, and concentration  
Interactive grid drawing experience using Sigma JS  

## Technologies Used
Django  
Ajax  
Sigma JS
